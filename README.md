## 🖖 About Me

Hi! I’m that IT guy who scales not just PostgreSQL, but also parental patience (four kids — yes, **FOUR**, Carl!).

My superpower? Turning technical chaos into elegant architecture — and explaining it clearly to both moody servers and moody second-graders.  
Sometimes I speak Python instead of small talk. But hey, my code rhymes, and my deadlines are as fixed as the school Christmas play schedule.

## 🎯 Why Work With Me?

- I deliver. On time. With empathy.  
- I translate chaos into clarity — both in code and team chats.  
- I bridge devs and ops like I make kids share a PlayStation.  
- After managing four tiny humans, *nothing* scares me (except maybe silent servers — that’s suspicious).  
- I love tough problems. Especially ones where the answer is *not* “just restart it.”

## ☕ Fun Facts

- Remote work is my zen.  
- My calendar is better organized than a space shuttle launch (thanks, Alice!).  
- There’s a cat on my router — which means Wi-Fi is protected.  
- I bring cookies to Zoom calls. Sometimes metaphorical.  
- I believe perfect code and happy families are built the same way: clarity, resilience, love... and coffee.

## 🐬 Final Note

> “My Alice told me to mention I’m humble.  
But let’s face it: humility doesn’t keep systems highly available.”

Let’s talk — your systems will run smoother, and I might finally get her that dolphin.
